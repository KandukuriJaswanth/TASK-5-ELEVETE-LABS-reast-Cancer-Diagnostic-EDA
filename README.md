# Breast Cancer Diagnostic EDA

This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a breast cancer diagnostic dataset to uncover key patterns that distinguish malignant and benign tumors.

## üîç Objective
To identify the most informative features that predict cancer diagnosis using data-driven visual and statistical techniques.

## üß∞ Process Overview

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Handled missing values, corrected column names, dropped redundant data, and ensured consistent data types.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Added interpretable metrics like `area_perimeter_ratio` and z-scored versions of key predictors to enhance analysis clarity.

- **Correlation Analysis**  
  Used heatmaps and pairplots to identify high-impact predictors (`concave_points_worst`, `perimeter_worst`, `radius_worst`) with strong relationship to cancer classification.

- **Visualizations**  
  - Histograms to understand distribution patterns  
  - Boxplots to compare features across diagnosis labels  
  - Scatter matrices to detect class separability

- **Quality Checks**  
  Validated data integrity (no missing or duplicate rows), monitored memory usage, and scanned for extreme outliers.

- **Insight Summary**  
  Summarized top signals, skewness issues, and multicollinearity flags‚Äîleading to actionable takeaways for downstream modeling.

## üìà Key Outcomes

- Identified 5+ highly predictive features for malignancy detection.
- Demonstrated strong class separation using pairwise plots.
- Generated interpretable visuals to support domain understanding.

## üí° Next Steps

- Train classification models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Use SHAP or LIME to explain model decisions
- Consider feature scaling or PCA for advanced pipelines
